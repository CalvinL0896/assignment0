  <center><p><b>Let's take a look into the journey of stars. It’s important to look back on how the first stars were formed. The process stars follow, is important, as well as the phases it conforms to, to reach its culmination. In order for stars to experience all stages in their journey, it needs to endure multiple changes and challenges. </p>

<p>The sun has been generating 400 billion billion megawatts of power for the past 5 billion years with nuclear fusion as its power source. Nuclear fusion is a process in which lighter atoms combine with each other to make heavier atoms. There are nuclei that are smashing into each other at very high speeds, causing sparks of energy to linger and make power for the sun to sustain itself.</p>


<p>Moreover, the concept of the nuclei of atoms is simplistic. The atoms are made up of protons and neutrons. The amount of protons determines the type of atom. For example, sulfur, helium, or carbon. Neutrons will keep the protons from repelling because without them, the protons would repel. </p>

<p>Neon, a heavy atom, is assembled by lighter atoms such as helium and when this happens, energy is released. For example, if you were to extract and merge hydrogen from a gallon of water to form helium, it would create power and could sustain NYC for three days</p>


<p>Furthermore, the criteria for starting the process of nuclear fusion is the intense and extreme temperature and density of the atoms. The Sun's core contains a few octillion tons of gas pressure which is enough to have the sun reach about 10 million degrees Celsius. At this temperature, the protons of a hydrogen nucleus are moving faster than the eye can see and this nullifies their mutual repulsion.</p>


<p>Not only is there continuous fusion of protons that form Helium at the core of the sun, but energy is also  produced and released into the core. This process continuously supplies enough energy to repel the force of gravity and maintain the star for billions of years. The gamma rays released follow an unusual path through the star until it emerges as a visible light source, millions of years later.  Nuclear fusion isn't a permanent process. Eventually, the sun runs out of hydrogen causing helium to build up. As a result, the life of smaller stars comes to an end.
Depending on the mass of the star, it will determine its life. A life span of a star with low mass will be cut short. Alternatively, massive stars, such as our sun, have a different result; they can turn into red giants. In the process, the core contracts and creates energy and heat, reaching extraordinarily high temperatures. A star begins a new phase in which helium is transformed into Oxygen, Carbon, and Neon. As a result, nuclear fuel is depleted from the star, the core slowly contracts causing it to start expanding. Every time it starts to heat up, it ignites off a new round of fusion.</p>

<p>The more mass the star contains determines the amount of times it can set off a new round of fusion. If the core has more mass, then it can produce more pressure and a higher temperature. After producing Carbon, Oxygen, and Neon, most stars, like our sun, cease to exist as a star. As a result, the core transforms into a white dwarf as the outer layers disperse into outer space.</p>


<p>A star with the mass of 8 suns can form iron through complex chemical chain reactions, and form nickel, a metal. At this point the core has reached about several billion degrees. Contrary to this, stars with the mass of 2 stars use up their helium, and the core's contraction raises the temperature to a billion degrees. At this point, carbon and oxygen begin to fuse and form heavier elements such as sodium, magnesium, silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur. </p>


<p>Once the star’s core is made up of iron, it doesn’t have much of an option left. During the star’s journey it goes through numerous phases, but within every phase the star experiences, it propels energy into the core. As a result, the star's source of energy is depleted causing the core to collapse. The excess gas collapses into the core making the core become stiff which leads to the creation of an exotic Neutron star.</p>

<p>Isn’t it ironic that the biggest stars in existence are fueled by something small? They have 2 particles fusing together that release energy combined with other ongoing chain reactions which can power the star with energy for billions of years. Every time a star dies, the atoms/seeds are dispersed, setting off the generation of stars. </b></p></center>
